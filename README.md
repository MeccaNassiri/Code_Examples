# Code Examples
A few examples of various scripts/functions I have written using C# and HLSL (generally in the Unity Engine)

All the scripts included in here are part of larger scripts, and a larger project. In this respect, instead of including functions these scripts reference from other scripts, I have simply commented in the functionality of any function being called that is not included in the script itself (if it's necessary for the understanding of the script)
